a common format enables the exchange of structured CVE data and metadata and enables the automation of key CVE workflows.

## Objectives:
- Provide support for language translations
- Accommodate additional data fields
- Establish file naming and JSON formatting style conventions
- Support structural and semantic validation of JSON
- Promote efficient generation and parsing
- Ensure backwards compatibility
- Support for multiple information providers publishing data to the same CVE record
## Proposed Activities:
- Document workflows
- Develop user stories that describe the:
  - Capabilities to be provided by the service
  - Resources required and dependencies that exist
  - Assumptions/Constraints
  - Acceptance criteria
- Document the business, user, functional, security and performance requirements for the proposed capabilities.
